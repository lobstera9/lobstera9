# CURRENT PROJECT
1. FrugalYou

    It is a hobby project that I am developing with Springboot with Thymeleaf as internal render engine. The project focuses on a way of tracking the finances. The main focus of the project is to be capable of porting the data to any space and keeping the data private which is why I am making use of sqlite.
